The set up was easy, and I was able to get it set up the way I wanted almost immediately. It was much quicker than I thought it would be.  If I had a complaint it would be that the DVD drawer on the side seems to be a little flimsy. I feel like I have to be extra careful with it. I like the keyboard but not the mouse.

But I felt depressed with this desk I pimped out with led lights and cool pics of all of my family. So thats why I got this. <<wrote all this and now 6 short months later I don\\'t even use it. It\\'s slow, loud, cheaply made. The specs seemed to be that of meeting my needs. I can\\'t even play YouTube vids past 1080p. My 3 year old laptop xps is way more on point. I ended up buying a 34\" ultrawide curved monitor and have the laptop hidden behind that which is such a better option. I\\'m trying to give this thing away.
